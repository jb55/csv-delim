* CSV Tools

** Base csv command
*** Field inference
**** Detect number fields, don't write quote in those
**** Separate utility file so that can be used by other commands

** cut
*** field parsing clib
*** column name field selector?

** Too lazy to do right now
*** Move file handling to base?
We don't need to get as general as git does
We should be able to just pass the stream to the subcommands?
