* CSV Tools

** Base csv command
*** Field inference
**** Detect number fields, don't write quote in those
**** Separate utility file so that can be used by other commands

** Commands to implement
*** cut
**** field parsing clib
We can just GPL this and use coreutils field parser?
**** column name field selector?
*** id
Identity transform, can be used to tweak
input and output delimiters

** Too lazy to do right now
*** Error handling
*** Move file handling to base?
We don't need to get as general as git does
We should be able to just pass the stream to the subcommands?
